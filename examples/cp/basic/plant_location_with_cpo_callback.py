"""
A ship-building company has a certain number of customers. Each customer is supplied
by exactly one plant. In turn, a plant can supply several customers. The problem is
to decide where to set up the plants in order to supply every customer while minimizing
the cost of building each plant and the transportation cost of supplying the customers.

For each possible plant location there is a fixed cost and a production capacity.
Both take into account the country and the geographical conditions.

For every customer, there is a demand and a transportation cost with respect to
each plant location.

While a first solution of this problem can be found easily by CP Optimizer, it can take
quite some time to improve it to a very good one. We illustrate the warm start capabilities
of CP Optimizer by giving a good starting point solution that CP Optimizer will try to improve.
This solution could be one from an expert or the result of another optimization engine
applied to the problem.

In the solution we only give a value to the variables that determine which plant delivers
a customer. This is sufficient to define a complete solution on all model variables.
CP Optimizer first extends the solution to all variables and then starts to improve it.

The solve is enriched with a CPO callback, available from version of COS greater or equal to 12.10.0.0.
This callback displays various information generated during the solve, in particular intermediate
solutions that are found before the end of the solve.
