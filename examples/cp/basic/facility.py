"""
A company has 8 stores.
Each store must be supplied by one warehouse.
The company has 5 possible locations where it has property and can build a
supplier warehouse: Bonn, Bordeaux, London, Paris, and Rome.

The warehouse locations have different capacities. A warehouse built in Bordeaux
or Rome could supply only one store ; a warehouse built in London could supply
two stores; a warehouse built in Bonn could supply three stores; and a warehouse
built in Paris could supply four stores.

The supply costs vary for each store, depending on which warehouse is the
supplier. For example, a store that is located in Paris would have low supply
costs if it were supplied by a warehouse also in Paris.  That same store would
have much higher supply costs if it were supplied by the other warehouses.

The cost of building a warehouse varies depending on warehouse location.

The problem is to find the most cost-effective solution to this problem, while
making sure that each store is supplied by a warehouse.

Please refer to documentation for appropriate setup of solving configuration.
