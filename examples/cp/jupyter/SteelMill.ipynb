There is no limitation in the number of slabs that can be requested, but only a finite number of slab sizes is available (sizes 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34, 40, 43, 45). \n",
    "* The problem is to select a number of slabs to build the coil orders, and to satisfy the following constraints:\n",
    "    * A coil order can be built from only one slab.\n",
    "    * Each coil order requires a specific process to build it from a slab. This process is encoded by a color.\n",
    "    * Several coil orders can be built from the same slab. But a slab can be used to produce at most two different \"colors\" of coils.\n",
    "    * The sum of the sizes of each coil order built from a slab must not exceed the slab size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, the production plan should minimize the unused capacity of the selected slabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
