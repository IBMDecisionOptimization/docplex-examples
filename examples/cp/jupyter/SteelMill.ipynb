    "* The problem is to build steel coils from slabs that are available in a work-in-process inventory of semi-finished products. There is no limitation in the number of slabs that can be requested, but only a finite number of slab sizes is available (sizes 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34, 40, 43, 45). \n",
    "* The problem is to select a number of slabs to build the coil orders, and to satisfy the following constraints:\n",
    "    * A coil order can be built from only one slab.\n",
    "    * Each coil order requires a specific process to build it from a slab. This process is encoded by a color.\n",
    "    * Several coil orders can be built from the same slab. But a slab can be used to produce at most two different \"colors\" of coils.\n",
    "    * The sum of the sizes of each coil order built from a slab must not exceed the slab size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, the production plan should minimize the unused capacity of the selected slabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* This problem is based on **\"prob038: Steel mill slab design problem\" from CSPLib (www.csplib.org). It is a simplification of an industrial problem described in J. R. Kalagnanam, M. W. Dawande, M. Trumbo, H. S. Lee. \"Inventory Matching Problems in the Steel Industry,\" IBM Research Report RC 21171, 1998**.\n",
