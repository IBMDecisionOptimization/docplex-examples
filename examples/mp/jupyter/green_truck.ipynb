    "* A trucking company has a hub and spoke system. The shipments to be delivered are specified by an originating spoke, a destination spoke, and a shipment volume. The trucks have different types defined by a maximum capacity, a speed, and a cost per mile. The model assigns the correct number of trucks to each route in order to minimize the cost of transshipment and meet the volume requirements. There is a minimum departure time and a maximum return time for trucks at a spoke, and a load and unload time at the hub. Trucks of different types travel at different speeds. Therefore, shipments are available at each hub in a timely manner. Volume availability constraints are taken into account, meaning that the shipments that will be carried back from a hub to a spoke by a truck must be available for loading before the truck leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The assumptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Exactly the same number of trucks that go from spoke to hub return from hub to spoke.\n",
    "   * Each truck arrives at a hub as early as possible and leaves as late as possible.\n",
    "   * The shipments can be broken arbitrarily into smaller packages and shipped through different paths."
