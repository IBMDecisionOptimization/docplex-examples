    "For some optimization problems the decision variables should take integer values. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One example is problems involving the production of large indivisible items, such as airplanes or cars.  It usually does not make sense to use a continuous variable to represent the number of airplanes to produce, because there is no point in manufacturing a partial airplane, and each finished airplane involves a large cost.  \n",

    "Finally, integer variables are often used to model logic between different decision, for example that a given tax break is only applicable if a certain investment is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different types of integer decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many types of decisions can be modeled by using integer variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example is yes/no decisions, with a value of 1 for yes, and 0 for no. For example, if x equals 1, new manufacturing equipment should be installed, and if x equals 0, it should not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integer variables are also used to model state or mode decisions. For example, if z1 equals 1 the machine operates in mode 1, if z2 equals 1, the machine operates in mode 2, and if z3 equals 1 the machine operates in mode 3.  The same integer is often used to express both yes/no decisions and logic. For example, y1 equals 1 could in this case also be used to indicate that machine 1 is installed, and 0 otherwise. \n",

Binary variables are also often referred to as Boolean variables because the Boolean values of true and false are analogous to 1 and 0. \n",

    "Securities sometimes covary, that is, they change together with some classes of securities, and in the opposite direction of other classes of securities. An example of positive covariance is when shares in technology companies follow similar patterns of increases and decreases in value. On the other hand, as the price of oil rises, shares in oil companies may increase in value, but plastics manufacturers, who depend on petroleum as a major primary resource, may see their shares decline in value as their costs go up and vice versa. This is negative covariance. \n",
