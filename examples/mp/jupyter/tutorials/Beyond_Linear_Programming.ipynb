    "- One example is problems involving the production of large indivisible items, such as airplanes or cars.  It usually does not make sense to use a continuous variable to represent the number of airplanes to produce, because there is no point in manufacturing a partial airplane, and each finished airplane involves a large cost.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Many types of decisions can be modeled by using integer variables. \n",
    "\n",

For example, if z1 equals 1 the machine operates in mode 1, if z2 equals 1, the machine operates in mode 2, and if z3 equals 1 the machine operates in mode 3.

    "Securities sometimes covary, that is, they change together with some classes of securities, and in the opposite direction of other classes of securities. An example of positive covariance is when shares in technology companies follow similar patterns of increases and decreases in value. On the other hand, as the price of oil rises, shares in oil companies may increase in value, but plastics manufacturers, who depend on petroleum as a major primary resource, may see their shares decline in value as their costs go up and vice versa. This is negative covariance. \n",
