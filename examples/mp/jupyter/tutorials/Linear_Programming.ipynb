    "## What is Linear Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear programming deals with the maximization (or minimization) of a linear objective function, subject to linear constraints, where all the decision variables are continuous. That is, no discrete variables are allowed. The linear objective and constraints must consist of linear expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a linear expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear expression is a scalar product, for example, the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum{a_i x_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where a_i represents constants (that is, data) and x_i represents variables or unknowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an expression can also be written in short form as a vector product:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$^{t}A X\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is the vector of constants and $X$ is the vector of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: Nonlinear terms that involve variables (such as x and y) are not allowed in linear expressions. \n",
    "Terms that are not allowed in linear expressions include \n",
    "- multiplication of two or more variables (such as x times y), \n",
