    "This notebook illustrates how to solve an optimization model using Lagrangian relaxation technics. \n",
    "It solves a generalized assignment problem (GAP), as defined by Wolsey, using this relaxation technic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim is to show multiple optimization through modifications of different models existing in a single environment, not to show how to solve a GAP problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of Mathematical Programming, this technic consists in the approximation of a difficult constrained problem by a simpler problem: you remove difficult constraints by integrating them in the objective function, penalizing it if the constraint is not respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method penalizes violations of inequality constraints using a Lagrange multiplier, which imposes a cost on violations. These added costs are used instead of the strict inequality constraints in the optimization. In practice, this relaxed problem can often be solved more easily than the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see the following Wikipedia articles: [Generalized assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_assignment_problem) and [Lagrangian relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_relaxation).\n",

    "\n",
    "Prescriptive analytics (decision optimization) technology recommends actions that are based on desired outcomes. It considers specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. With this insight, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control over business outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes. Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle a future situation. Organizations that act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "With prescriptive analytics, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automate the complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage your limited resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Proactively update recommendations based on changing events.\n",
