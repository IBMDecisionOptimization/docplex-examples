# IBM&reg; Decision Optimization Modeling for Python (DOcplex)

Welcome to the IBM&reg; Decision Optimization Modeling for Python.
Licensed under the Apache License v2.0.

With this library, you can quickly and easily add the power of optimization to
your application. You need IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio to solve the models.

This library is composed of 2 modules:

* IBM&reg; Decision Optimization CPLEX Optimizer Modeling for Python - with namespace docplex.mp
* IBM&reg; Decision Optimization CP Optimizer Modeling for Python - with namespace docplex.cp

Solving with CPLEX requires that IBM&reg; ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V12.10 or later
is installed on your machine.

This library is numpy friendly.

## Install the library

```
   pip install docplex
```
